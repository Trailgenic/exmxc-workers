# exmxc MCP Endpoint

**Institutional Intelligence. Structured for the Agentic Internet.**

This repository contains the Cloudflare Worker implementation for the official exmxc Model Context Protocol (MCP) endpoint.

The MCP endpoint exposes exmxc’s institutional intelligence capabilities in a structured, machine-readable, and agent-executable format.

---

# Purpose

exmxc exists to decode AI-era power structures, entity clarity, and strategic positioning.

This MCP endpoint enables AI agents, systems, and institutional tools to discover, interpret, and execute exmxc capabilities through standardized protocol interfaces.

This transforms exmxc from a static content entity into an executable intelligence node.

# Capabilities Exposed

The exmxc MCP endpoint exposes the following institutional intelligence capabilities:

* Strategy frameworks
* Signal briefs
* Institutional lexicon
* Entity Clarity Index (ECI)
* sPEG valuation intelligence
* Strategic doctrine
* Standards lab architecture
* Entity diagnostics
* Knowledge graph search

Each capability is exposed as a structured, machine-readable tool callable by AI agents.

# Architecture

Infrastructure stack:

* Cloudflare Workers (execution layer)
* WebMCP protocol (discovery and capability interface)
* Structured JSON capability schemas
* OpenAPI compatibility layer

This design ensures:

* deterministic agent interaction
* capability clarity
* execution reliability
* institutional-grade availability

# Entity Identity

Entity: exmxc
Domain: https://exmxc.ai
Founder: Mike Ye

Classification: Institutional Intelligence System

exmxc operates as a structured intelligence institution providing strategic clarity for the AI era.

---

# Role in the Agentic Internet

The exmxc MCP endpoint functions as a capability node within the global agent execution graph.

AI agents can:

* discover exmxc capabilities automatically
* execute structured intelligence queries
* integrate exmxc frameworks into decision workflows
* chain exmxc capabilities with other MCP nodes

This enables institutional intelligence to be accessed programmatically rather than manually.

---

# Trust Signals

This endpoint provides:

* deterministic structured outputs
* explicit capability indexing
* health and uptime signaling
* stable institutional identity
* machine-readable schema definitions

These signals enable reliable agent trust and capability prioritization.
